# Netflix Frontend Clone

## Project Overview

The **Netflix Frontend Clone** is a responsive and visually appealing website that closely mimics the user interface of Netflix. This project was crafted using only **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on replicating key design elements to provide an authentic user experience.

## Features

- **Dynamic Homepage:** The layout features a sleek header that includes the Netflix logo, navigation links, and a sign-in button.
- **Content Browsing Experience:** Below the header, multiple sections showcase movie posters in horizontally scrollable carousels, offering an interactive feel similar to Netflixâ€™s popular content browsing experience.
